This project is a React.js application that features a text input box where users can enter paragraphs of text. The application provides functionality to transform the input text in the following ways:

-Convert to Upper Case: Converts all text entered into uppercase letters.
-Convert to Lower Case: Converts all text entered into lowercase letters.
-Remove Extra Spaces: Removes extra spaces between words to ensure clean and readable text output.
The application aims to provide a simple and intuitive user interface using React components and state management to dynamically update and display the transformed text in real-time as users interact with the input box.
